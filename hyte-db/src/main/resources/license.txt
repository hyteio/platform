SECTION 4.	LIMITED WARRANTIES.

4.1	Licensed Software Warranty.  During the Licensed Software Warranty Period and subject to Licensee’s payment of the Support Services fees set by HYTE Technologies, HYTE Technologies warrants that the Licensed Software will substantially conform in all material respects to the Documentation.  HYTE Technologies further warrants that before it delivers the Licensed Software to Licensee, it has used generally available tools to protect the Licensed Software against any malicious codes, such as viruses, worms, or trojan horses.

4.2 Exclusive Remedies.  Licensee shall promptly notify HYTE Technologies in writing of any claimed breach of a warranty contained in Section 4.1.  HYTE Technologies is not obligated to correct any such breach if Licensee fails to promptly notify HYTE Technologies in writing within the applicable Licensed Software Warranty Period, which notice must provide a detailed description of the specific existence and nature of the alleged breach upon Licensee’s discovery thereof.  Licensee’s sole and exclusive remedy and HYTE Technologies’s entire liability for any such breach of warranty is as follows:  

4.2.1 Licensed Software.  Provided a breach exists that is covered by the Licensed Software Warranty, HYTE Technologies shall as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 30 days after HYTE Technologies’s receipt of Licensee’s written notice of breach, (a) correct such breach; (b) provide Licensee with a plan reasonably acceptable to Licensee for correcting the breach at HYTE Technologies’s expense and in a reasonably timely fashion; or (c) if neither (a) nor (b) can be accomplished with reasonable commercial efforts from HYTE Technologies, then either HYTE Technologies or Licensee may terminate the license for the affected Licensed Software.  If a license is terminated by either party under this subsection, Licensee shall de-install the applicable Licensed Software and return all copies of such Licensed Software and related Documentation to HYTE Technologies.  If Licensee elects not to terminate the license for the affected portion of the Licensed Software, Licensee waives all rights for the applicable breach of the warranty set forth in Section 4.1.  Upon return of the Licensed Software and related Documentation, then as Licensee’s sole remedy, HYTE Technologies agrees to refund any and all related Support Services fees paid to HYTE Technologies under this Agreement for the affected Licensed Software so returned.  

4.3 Disclaimer of Warranty.  EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION 4, NEITHER HYTE Technologies NOR ITS LICENSORS MAKE ANY WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION, CONDITION OR AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE LICENSED PRODUCTS.  HYTE Technologies AND ITS LICENSORS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM AND EXCLUDE TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  FURTHER, HYTE Technologies MAKES NO WARRANTIES, AND IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR, ANY THIRD PARTY PRODUCTS AND ANY SERVICES NOT PROVIDED SOLEY BY HYTE Technologies, OR ANY DAMAGES, DEFECTS, OR MALFUNCTIONS OR FAILURES CAUSED BY ANY UNAUTHORIZED MODIFICATION OF THE LICENSED PRODUCTS, DELIVERABLES, OR SERVICES.

SECTION 5.	TERM AND TERMINATION.

5.1	Term.  Unless earlier terminated as provided herein, the term of this Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues for 12 months after the Effective Date (the “Initial Term”).   Thereafter, this Agreement will automatically renew for successive periods of 12 months each (each, a “Renewal Term” and together with the Initial Term, the “Term”) unless either party provides the other party with written notice of its intent not to renew this Agreement at least 60 days prior to the expiration of the then-current Term.  

5.2 Termination; Effect of Termination.  HYTE Technologies may terminate this Agreement immediately and without notice for any violation of HYTE Technologies’s intellectual property rights.  Either party may terminate this Agreement for cause if the other party has materially breached this Agreement and has not corrected such breach within 30 days (or within five days for any failure to make a required payment) after its receipt of written notice specifying such breach from the non-breaching party.  Upon termination for cause or upon expiration, Licensee shall immediately discontinue all use of the Licensed Products and return to HYTE Technologies or destroy all copies of same.  Upon the request of HYTE Technologies, Licensee shall deliver a letter signed by a duly authorized officer of Licensee certifying compliance with the requirements set forth herein.

5.2 Survival.  The provisions of Sections 2.2, 2.3, 7, 8, 9 and 11, all payment obligations that accrue prior to the expiration or termination hereof, and all others that by their sense and context are intended to survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement survive and continue in effect.

SECTION 6. INVOICING AND PAYMENT.

6.1 Support Services Fees.  In consideration of the license granted in Section 2 and the Support Services, Licensee shall pay to HYTE Technologies Support Services fees for the Licensed Software in the amount of set by HYTE Technologies. 

6.2 Taxes.  All amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement are (i) exclusive of any sales or use taxes, value added tax (VAT), goods and services tax (GST), or any and all similar taxes or legally imposed fees, duties, or contributions based upon such amounts payable, all of which are the sole responsibility of Licensee and (ii) reflect the net cash payable to HYTE Technologies, net of any and all taxes, levies or withholdings of any nature.  Income taxes may be withheld from such amounts payable only to the extent legally required under existing tax laws of Licensee’s legal country of domicile and after full consideration of applicable income tax treaty provisions, if any, by and between HYTE Technologies’s and Licensee’s respective legal countries of domicile.  In the event such income taxes are withheld, Licensee shall forward such withheld tax to the appropriate tax authorities within the legally required timeframe and shall provide HYTE Technologies with an official receipt evidencing payment of the withheld tax to the proper tax authorities.  Such receipt must be provided to HYTE Technologies within 10 days after payment by Licensee of the withheld tax to the tax authorities.  If Licensee fails to timely provide HYTE Technologies with such receipt, Licensee shall pay to HYTE Technologies the full amount of taxes withheld for which such receipt was not provided in accordance with this paragraph.  Licensee is not responsible for any taxes based upon the net income of HYTE Technologies or its employees.  

6.3 Invoices.  Licensee shall pay all amounts due under this Agreement upon receipt of each applicable invoice from HYTE Technologies.  Any amounts that remain unpaid for 30 days after the date of the applicable invoice will bear interest from the invoice date until the date payment is received by HYTE Technologies at a rate that is the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the highest rate permitted by applicable law.  All payments made under this Agreement are nonrefundable, except as specifically provided to the contrary in this Agreement.

SECTION 7.	INDEMNIFICATION BY LICENSEE. 

7.1 Indemnity by Licensee.

SECTION 8.	CONFIDENTIALITY. 

8.1	Definition.  As used herein, “Confidential Information” means all confidential or proprietary information belonging to either party hereto and disclosed, made available to or learned by the other party during the Term of this Agreement, including, without limitation, technical, business, financial and marketing information, third party confidential information, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and, with respect to HYTE Technologies, the Licensed Products.
